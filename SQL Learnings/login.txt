#If getting errors from trying to do SQL-based authentication, from your c# code or whatever, means you must set up SQL-based authentication or mixed mode (Windows AND SQL-based) for your server


SQL Server setup:
On Windows 8, use MS SQL Management Studio:

[1] Security -> Properties --> Change the authentication mode to mixed (the option with both Windows and SQL-based)
[2] Security -> Logins --> sa --> Properties --> Change the password into something like 'password' or w/e. 
    Somehow make sure 'sa' is enabled. 
	I had to use cmd to do that
	
	[Windows]-R ---> cmd ---> sqlcmd -S localhost\SqlExpress     #name of my server. You can see it in MS SQL Management Studio Windows
	  -- you are logged in as 'dbo' (db owner, not the same as database_owner)
	  -- default can use database 'Master'
	ALTER LOGIN sa ENABLE ;
    GO
	USE MASTER;
	GO

Some SQL commands:
In command prompt, must write 'Go' after when you intend to execute prior commands.

Some userful commands:
-- comment
-- print names of all db users
SELECT name FROM sys.database_principals;
